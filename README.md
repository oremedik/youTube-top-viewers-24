The Head of Marketing wants to find out who the top YouTubers are in 2024 to decide on which YouTubers would be best to run marketing campaigns throughout the rest of the year.

To create a dashboard that provides insights into the top UK YouTubers in 2024 that includes their

# User story
I want to use a dashboard that analyses YouTube channel data in the UK .

This dashboard should allow me to identify the top performing channels based on metrics like subscriber base and average views.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about which Youtubers are right to collaborate with, and therefore maximize how effective each marketing campaign is.

## Dashboard components required

What should the dashboard contain based on the requirements provided?
To understand what it should contain, we need to figure out what questions we need the dashboard to answer:

Who are the top 10 YouTubers with the most subscribers?

Which 3 channels have uploaded the most videos?

Which 3 channels have the most views?

Which 3 channels have the highest average views per video?

Which 3 channels have the highest views per subscriber ratio?

Which 3 channels have the highest subscriber engagement rate per video uploaded?

For now, these are some of the questions we need to answer, this may change as we progress down our analysis.
